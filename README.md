## Description

**DEAD END** is an enthralling immersive experience that puts the player into the story. It takes input from the user and makes them feel like their choices are affecting the outcome of the game. Utilizing advanced realism technologies and cutting-edge text graphics, DEAD END is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity you'll surely remember for years to come. Our goal with DEAD END has always been—and will always be—to provide fun for players. We believe that if we are not having fun writing and coding the story, how could the user have fun playing? So every day of work is a day of fun for us here at DEAD END!
